<h3>Deep Learning AI | Semiconductor | Strategy | PT Ivy League Prof </h3>
<p>I am an executive in the <b>semiconductor &amp; AI</b> industry, with a broad range of experience spanning technology development, SOC design management, and ownership of multi-billion dollar product lines. I leverage my expertise in engineering and analytics, including ML/AI, business analytics, and marketing automation, to drive both business and technology excellence.
</p>
<p>With <b>over 20 years of leadership experience</b> within matrix organizations, I have successfully synergized efforts across all key domains—engineering, finance, planning, business development, and customer experience—while leading teams across multiple continents. I am known for my decisive action, results orientation, and discipline. My experience also includes developing and nurturing teams, providing thought leadership, and crafting strategies to address challenges and lead successful and flawless execution. I have successfully delivered technology and IPs in billions of devices spanning diverse market verticals from CPU, cloud, to edge.
</p>
<p>My background in <b>artificial intelligence and machine learning</b> encompasses the full spectrum from theory to implementation and application. This includes deep learning, convolutional neural networks, sequence models such as LSTM and RNN, and large-language models like transformers. I possess in-depth experience in translating high-level architectures into practical implementations, optimizing computation, and enhancing dataflow architecture and bandwidth/throughput. Additionally, I have expertise in architecting AI/ML solutions integrated with big data in cloud environments, involving real-time streaming technologies like Spark and scalable microservices such as AWS Lambda.
</p>
<p>I am also deeply passionate about teaching and currently serve as a <b>part-time instructor at Columbia University and Cornell University.</b> My teaching focuses on innovation strategy, AI strategy, deep learning, ML/AI, and algorithms, with an emphasis on blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications for executives and working professionals.
</p>
<p>I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree with First Class Honors in Computer Engineering from <b>The University of Hong Kong</b> and subsequently obtained my M.S., M.Phil., and Ph.D. from <b>Columbia University in the City of New York</b>. I have authored over 20 publications in leading IEEE and ACM journals and conferences and currently hold five U.S. patents, with several others pending.
