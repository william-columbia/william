<dt><b>Tom Thomas - Sr. Hardware Design Engineer at Intel</b>
(Tom reported directly to William)</dt>
<dd><p><br /> I worked for William Li as part of the Programmable Solutions Group SoC development team at Intel Corporation. The projects under development included high frequency ARM core hardening on advanced process nodes.  <br /><br /> William has exemplary communication skills as well as deep technical knowledge spanning semiconductor process technology, circuit design, and SoC design. He was adept at managing difficult situations - balancing stretch goals from high level management with the technical realities of what was achievable. He has the depth of knowledge to contribute technically across a spectrum of semiconductor tasks as well as the soft skills to effectively manage teams. I would highly recommend his management and technical abilities.

<dd><p><br /> William and I collaborated on ARM SoC and hardware security R&amp;D, where he served as the project lead. Throughout our time together, William demonstrated an exceptional breadth and depth of technical knowledge. His expertise spans the entire product lifecycle, including design, validation, physical design, silicon validation, and production ramp. He consistently delved into the details when necessary, working closely with the team on critical aspects such as timing and reliability. <br /><br /> William worked effectively with his peers, placing a strong emphasis on teamwork. He was committed to resolving roadblocks and mediating differences to foster a high-performing team, while also displaying the assertiveness required in challenging situations. His priorities were always clear: the success of the project, the excellence of the team, and the well-being of its members. <br /><br /> In addition to his technical and leadership skills, William adeptly guided the team through various challenges and successfully negotiated with other teams to achieve win-win outcomes. <br /><br /> I highly value the time we worked together and hold William in great esteem as a leader.

<dd><p><br /> It gives me immense pleasure to write on behalf of Dr. William Li! <br /><br /> I first got to know William as my instructor at Columbia University as part of the Executive AI/ML program. Through many months of instruction, Williamâ€™s genuine care about the knowledge and understanding of the subject matter being imparted to the students became obvious. His grasp of the topics being taught (as well as other areas where our interests took us) was remarkable! <br /><br /> Every one of my questions was clearly and thoughtfully answered. Concepts were meticulously articulated and methodically explained (including great pointers to white papers to substantiate the matter being discussed). <br /><br /> I wish William brilliant success in all his future endeavors!
